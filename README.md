# project-2 : Data Preprocessing and Analysis Project
### Team Members: Dalal Alharbi - Abdullah Alfayez - Mohammed Alzaidani 
## Problem statement: 
  This project aims to analyze historical weather data for the regions of Saudi Arabia and
  identify trends and patterns in temperature.
## Objectives:
  *	clean historical weather data for Saudi Arabia regions from 2017 to 2019.
  * Analyze the data to identify trends and patterns in temperature.
  * Visualize the data using appropriate charts and graphs to communicate the findings.
  * Identify any correlations between temperature, and other factors such as wind, time of year, and humidity.
## Overview over dataset:
  We chose this dataset from Kaggle, it provides hourly historical weather data for Saudi Arabia regions from 2017 to 2019. Consists
  of many features like temperature, wind, humidity, barometer, and visibility.
### Through the data visualization process, we Derive the following insights:
- The highest average temperature recorded was in the Mecca region.
- The highest average temperature over three years was in Mecca, Medina, and Riyadh.
- The lowest average temperature recorded was in the Asir region.
- Over three years Jawf region had the lowest temperature in SA it reached -4.
- Over three years there were many regions where temperatures reached below zero: Hail, Jawf, Qassim, Tabouk, and the Northern border.
- The northern regions of SA are always the coldest in winter.
- There is a relationship between wind and temperature, we observe that in high temperatures there is high wind speed.
- In 2017, The EP reached the highest temp in SA which was 50.
- The most common temperatures recorded in the Riyadh region were between 20 to 35.
- There is no high variation between temperatures during these three years.
